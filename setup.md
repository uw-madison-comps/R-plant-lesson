This lesson assumes you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.

The latest version of R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

RStudio is an application (an integrated development environment or IDE) that facilitates the use of R and offers a number of nice additional features. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You will need the free Desktop version for your computer.

[Click here to download the zipped dataset](https://github.com/uw-madison-comps/R-plant-lesson/raw/gh-pages/data/R-plant-lesson-data.zip).  Then you should unzip (and extract on Windows) and move to your Desktop so it is easily accessible.
