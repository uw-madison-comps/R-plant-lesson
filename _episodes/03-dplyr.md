# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,especially for complicated operations. Enter **`dplyr`**. **`dplyr`** is a package for making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. 

You should already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an "umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.


The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.

2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new learners.

3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware of.

We have seen in our previous lesson that when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced (=converted) into the `factor` data type. We had to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`** to avoid this hidden argument to convert our data type. 

This time we will use the **`tidyverse`** package to read the data and avoid having to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`**

To load the package type:



```r
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library("tidyverse")
```

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are
returned.

This feature addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups - like plots or aquaria. Moving back and forth between these formats is nontrivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools for this and more sophisticated  data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this [handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`.


```r
plant_phys <- read_csv("data/Physiology_Environmental_Data.csv")
```

```r
## inspect the data
str(plant_phys)
```

We also need to load the iris data as a tibble for this lesson


```r
data(iris)
iris<-as_tibble(iris)
```



```r
## preview the data
View(plant_phys)
```
Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`

This is referred to as a "tibble". Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced in the previous episode. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, itonly prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one screen.

2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.


We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statisitcs on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`iris`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.


```r
select(iris, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.


```r
select(iris, -Sepal.Length, -Sepal.Width)
```

This will select all the variables in `iris` except `Sepal.Length`
and `Sepal.Width`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:


```r
filter(iris, Sepal.Length>5)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:


```r
iris2 <- filter(iris, Sepal.Length < 5)
iris_small <- select(iris2, Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:


```r
iris_sml <- select(filter(iris, Sepal.Length < 5), Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + 
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.


```r
iris %>%
  filter(Sepal.Length < 5) %>%
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `iris` dataset first through `filter()` to keep rows where `Sepal.Length` is less than 5, then through `select()` to keep only the `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, and `species` columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `iris`, *then* we `filter`ed for rows with `Sepal.Length < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species`, `Sepal.Length`, and `Sepal.Width`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:


```r
iris_sml <- iris %>%
  filter(Sepal.Length < 5) %>%
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)

iris_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:


```r
iris %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Ratio = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:


```r
iris %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Ratio = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width,
         Petal.Ratio = Petal.Length/Petal.Width)
```
#removed the NA example because iris doesn't have NAs

#Using dates in R

You may have noticed that we have 2 columns in the `plant_phys` dataset that
represent the date when the observations were made: `Year` and `DOY` (day of year).
This is a great, compact way to represent the date: it only takes 2 columns, and if you load the data into a spreadsheet program like excel, it won't be reformatted automatically. However, it's not very human readable. (I don't know what month day 169 is off the top of my head.)

R has a package called `lubridate` that can convert to and from various date formats. Let's install and load the package:


```r
install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)
```

The as.Date function converts other data types (such as the integers in the `Year` and `DOY` columns) into date format. 

For example, we could use the following syntax to get the date for DOY = 1 and Year = 2015.

```r
one_date<-as.Date(paste(1,2015), format="%j %Y")
one_date
```

```
## [1] "2015-01-01"
```

```r
class(one_date)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```

To create a column called date that holds the date information in a human readable format, we can use mutate:


```r
plant_phys<-plant_phys%>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(paste(DOY,Year), format="%j %Y"))
```

This puts the newly created column at the end. To reorder the columns, we 
can use select:


```r
plant_phys<-plant_phys%>%
  select(Date, everything())
```

We can also split the date format out into its individual year/month/day components using the `month`, `day` and `year` functions:


```r
month(one_date)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
day(one_date)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
year(one_date)
```

```
## [1] 2015
```

```r
plant_phys <- plant_phys %>%
  mutate(Day = day(Date), 
         Month = month(Date))%>%
  select(Date, Year, Month, Day, DOY, everything())
```
# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want
to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good
practice to keep them separate. The `data` folder should only contain the raw,
unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify
it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data_output`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

We can save it as a CSV file in our `data_output` folder.
Let's save the dataset that that we created dates in.


```r
write_csv(plant_phys, path = "data_output/phys_dates.csv")
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `Sepal.Length` by `Species`:


```r
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

You can also group by multiple columns. For this, we'll need to use the `plant_phys` dataset:


```r
plant_phys %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo))
```


If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to display:


```r
plant_phys %>%  
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo)) %>% 
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:


```r
plant_phys %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo),
            min_photo = min(Photo))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_photo` to put the less photosynthetic first:



```r
plant_phys %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo),
            min_photo = min(Photo)) %>%
  arrange(min_photo)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:


```r
plant_phys %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo),
            min_photo = min(Photo)) %>%
  arrange(desc(min_photo))
```


#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:


```r
iris %>%
    count(Species) 
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `iris %>% count()` is equivalent to:  


```r
iris %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
```


Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `Species`).  If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `Species` and `Year`, we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:


```r
plant_phys %>%
  count(Year, Species) 
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table 
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. 
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of 
the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:


```r
plant_phys %>%
  count(Year, Species) %>%
  arrange(Species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75 observations of  the *albigula* species that are not specified for its sex (i.e. `NA`).

### Reshaping with gather and spread

There are four rules defining a tidy dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a table.

In `plant_phys` , the rows of `plant_phys` contain the values of variables associated with each record (the unit), values such the species or photosynthesis level of each plant associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we  wanted to compare the different mean photosynthesis level of each species between years?

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values of the species would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean photosynthesis level observed in each year.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore the relationship between the photosynthesis levels of different Species within, and between, the function groups. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest: average Photosynthesis rate per year instead of recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of
a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions, `spread()`
and `gather()`.

#### Spreading

`spread()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data 
2. the *key* column variable whose values will become new column names.  
3. the *value* column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.

Further arguments include `fill` which, if set, fills in missing values with the value provided.

Let's use `spread()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight of each species in each plot over the entire survey period. We use `filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` to filter our observations and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the `mean_photo`. We use the pipe as before too.


```r
phys_yp <- plant_phys %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_Photo = mean(Photo))

str(phys_yp)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
```
## Classes 'grouped_df', 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	16 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ Year      : int  2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2015 2015 ...

##   .. ..$ : int  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
##   ..- attr(*, ".drop")= logi TRUE
```

>>>>>>> cb306f1265117f53513a305f1b26c80400af2d8c
This yields `phys_yp` where the observations for each plot are spread across multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. 
Using `spread()` to key on `Species` with values from `mean_photo` this becomes 24 observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot. We again use pipes:


```r
phys_spread <- phys_yp %>%
  spread(key = Species, value = mean_Photo)

str(phys_spread)
```

![](fig/spread_data_R.png)

#### Gathering

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the form of `phys_spread`, where the genus names are column names, but wewish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into apair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and the other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.

`gather()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. the *key* column variable we wish to create from column names.
3. the *values* column variable we wish to create and fill with values 
associated with the key.
4. the names of the columns we use to fill the key variable (or to drop).

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_spread` we would create a key called `Species` and value called `mean_Photo` and use all columns except `Year` for the key variable. Here we drop `Year` column with a minus sign.


```r
phys_gather <- phys_spread %>%
  gather(key = Species, value = mean_Photo, -Year)

str(phys_gather)
```

![](fig/gather_data_R.png)

Spreading and then gathering can be a useful way to balance out a dataset so every replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it's easier to specify what to gather than what to leave alone.
